# GameFuryyyy

JavaScript game running on 10x10 board. Furry is responding to arrow 
keys being pressed and moves in designated direction.
The goal is to collect as many coins as possible. The moment you 
clash with the wall, the game ends. 

To run the project:

Clone the repository from GitHub. Run "npm install" to get all the modules.
After the installation is complete, simply "npm start" to run the 
webpack dev server and go to http://localhost:8080 and play the game. 


**Enjoy**
